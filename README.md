## Installation

a) Install the bsequencer (bsequencer-lv2) package for your system
* [Arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/bsequencer/) by David Runge
* [Free BSD](https://www.freshports.org/audio/bsequencer-lv2) by yurivict
* [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/audio/bsequencer/default.nix) by Bart Brouns
* [Debian](https://librazik.tuxfamily.org/doc3/logiciels/bsequencer) by Olivier Humbert
* [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/groovy/bsequencer)
* Check https://repology.org/project/bsequencer/versions for other systems

b) Build your own binaries in the following three steps.

Step 1: Clone or download this repository.

Step 2: Install pkg-config and the development packages for x11, cairo, and lv2 if not done yet. If you
don't have already got the build tools (compilers, make, libraries) then install them too.

On Debian-based systems you may run:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libx11-dev libcairo2-dev lv2-dev
```

On Arch-based systems you may run:
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel
sudo pacman -S pkg-config libx11 cairo lv2
```

Step 3: Building and installing into the default lv2 directory (/usr/local/lib/lv2/) is easy using `make` and
`make install`. Simply call:
```
make
sudo make install
```

**Optional:** Standard `make` and `make install` parameters are supported. Compiling using `make CPPFLAGS+=-O3`
is recommended to improve the plugin performance. Alternatively, you may build a debugging version using
`make CPPFLAGS+=-g`. For installation into an alternative directory (e.g., /usr/lib/lv2/), change the
variable `PREFIX` while installing: `sudo make install PREFIX=/usr`. If you want to freely choose the
install target directory, change the variable `LV2DIR` (e.g., `make install LV2DIR=~/.lv2`) or even define
`DESTDIR`.

**Optional:** Further supported parameters include `LANGUAGE` (usually two letters code) to change the GUI language
(see customize).


## Running

After the installation Carla, Ardour and any other LV2 host should automatically detect B.SEQuencer.

If jalv is installed, you can also call it
```
jalv.gtk https://www.jahnichen.de/plugins/lv2/BSEQuencer
```
to run it stand-alone and connect it to the JACK system.


## Usage

See https://github.com/sjaehn/BSEQuencer/wiki/B.SEQuencer


## Presets

B.SEQuencer comes along with a set of factory presets including arpeggios and drum patterns. You can also import
the large collection of Tidal Cycles drum patterns made by LVM from https://github.com/lvm/tidal-drum-patterns
using the Importpattern tool: https://github.com/sjaehn/Importpattern .


##Customize

You can create customized builds of B.SEQuenzr using the parameter `LANGUAGE`(e.g.,
`make LANGUAGE=DE`). To create a new language pack, copy `src/Locale_EN.hpp` and edit
the text for the respective definitions. But do not change or delete any definition symbol!


## What's new

* Bugfixes
* Link tool to import drum patterns to presets
* Support LANGUAGE parameter
* Add locales: EN, DE, IT (by LAM)
