Installation
------------
a) Install the bsequencer (bsequencer-lv2) package for your system
* [Arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/bsequencer/) by David Runge
* [Free BSD](https://www.freshports.org/audio/bsequencer-lv2) by yurivict
* [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/audio/bsequencer/default.nix) by Bart Brouns
* [Debian](https://librazik.tuxfamily.org/doc3/logiciels/bsequencer) by Olivier Humbert
* [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/groovy/bsequencer)
* Check https://repology.org/project/bsequencer/versions for other systems

b) Build your own binaries in the following three steps.

Step 1: Clone or download this repository.

Step 2: Install pkg-config and the development packages for x11, cairo, and lv2 if not done yet. On
Debian-based systems you may run:
```
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libx11-dev libcairo2-dev lv2-dev
```

Step 3: Building and installing into the default lv2 directory (/usr/lib/lv2/) is easy. Simply call:
```
make
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
```
from the directory where you downloaded the repository files. For installation into an
alternative directory (e.g., /usr/local/lib/lv2/), change the variable `PREFIX` while installing:

```
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
```


Running
-------
After the installation Carla, Ardour and any other LV2 host should automatically detect B.SEQuencer.

If jalv is installed, you can also call it
```
jalv.gtk https://www.jahnichen.de/plugins/lv2/BSEQuencer
```
to run it stand-alone and connect it to the JACK system.
